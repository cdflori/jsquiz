## Overview

I have created a simple timed quiz that covers questions relating to JavaScript. The user will be able to navigate through the quiz by selecting an answer. If the user answers the question correctly they will be notified with an alert "Your answer is correct!". Likewise if the user answers the question incorrectly they will be prompted with the alert "Your answer is wrong!" and will also have 15 seconds deducted from their overall time. Once the quiz is complete the user will be given their time (time elapsed before quiz was complete) and asked to write their initials into a "High Score" section. This will then store their highscores in local storage. 

## Time

The user will have 60 seconds on the clock when the quiz begins and be prompted with their first question.

## End of Quiz

Once the user is finished with the quiz, their time will appear along with a place to enter their initials for a highscore.
